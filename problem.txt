const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
for(x of fruits){
  console.log(x);
}

let num = 0;
    switch(true){
        case (num<0):
            text = "Negative";
            break;
        case (num==0):
            text = "Zero";
            break;
        case (num>0):
            text = "Positive";
            break;
        default:
            text = "No Value";
        }
console.log(text);
why it is not working when we write switch(num){} in second line.


Write a program to find the second largest among three of them.
We have three numbers as input A, B and C. Write a program to find the second largest among three of them.
Input
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three integers A, B and C.
Output
For each test case, display the second largest among A, B and C, in a new line.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 1000000
